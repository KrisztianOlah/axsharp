# ReadOnlyAttribute class

Attribute allows to prevent writing to the members of twin connector.

[`ReadOnlyAttribute`](./ReadOnlyAttribute.md) can be declared for member of a FB, GVL or STRUCT.

This attribute is typically defined in the declaration section of PLC block and then trans-piled by ixc builder.  Use of [`ReadOnlyAttribute`](./ReadOnlyAttribute.md) does not prevent the PLC program to write to the variable that declares this attribute.  This example demonstrates declaration of [`ReadOnlyAttribute`](./ReadOnlyAttribute.md) on a member of a FB.

```csharp
FUNCTION_BLOCK fbSomeReadOnlyMembers 
VAR
    {#ix-attr:[ReadOnly()]]}
    _nonWrittableItem : BOOL;       // Member is readonly for .net application.
    {#ix-attr:[ReadOnly()]]}
    _nonWrittableFunctionBlock : fbNonWrittable; // Member and its members are readonly for the .net application.
END_VAR
```

```csharp
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Property)]
public class ReadOnlyAttribute : Attribute
```
