# CompilerOmitsAttribute class

Prevents ixc builder to create a member for specific group of output type (Shadow, Plain, Onliner). This attribute must be declared in the PLC code to be effective during build process. This example demonstrates how to prevent the ixc builder to compile specific property into specific output group.

```csharp
// This will not compile to 'omitsInPlainString' member into respective 'Plain' type.
{#ix-attr:[CompilerOmits(CompilerOmissionGroups.BuilderPlainer))]} 
ommitsInPlainString : STRING(50) := 'THIS IS OMMITED IN PLAINER';     
// This will not compile to 'ommitsInPlainAndShadowerInterfaceString' member into respective 'Plain' type and Shadow interface.
{#ix-attr:[CompilerOmits(CompilerOmissionGroups.BuilderPlainer, CompilerOmissionGroups.BuilderShadowerInterface))]} 
ommitsInPlainAndShadowerInterfaceString : STRING(50) := 'THIS IS OMMITED IN PLAINER';     
```

```csharp
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Property)]
public class CompilerOmitsAttribute : Attribute
```
